    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Technology has always been more than just a career for meâ€”it's a passion that has shaped my life. 
        From a young age, I was captivated by computers and programming, spending countless hours learning new coding languages 
        and tinkering with software. This early fascination grew into a fulfilling career in IT engineering, 
        where I thrive in designing and managing complex systems. For me, programming and IT are not just skills; 
        they're essential parts of who I am and how I approach problem-solving and innovation.
         My commitment to continuous learning and staying current with technological  advancements has enabled me to make 
         significant contributions to my employers and the tech community at large.

        <h3>Work</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout my career in IT engineering, I have accomplished several significant milestones that highlight 
            my expertise and dedication. Leading a data center migration project, I ensured zero downtime and enhanced 
            infrastructure resilience, showcasing my ability to manage large-scale operations seamlessly. 
            My spearheading of a comprehensive cybersecurity initiative resulted in a 40% reduction in security incidents 
            and compliance with ISO 27001 standards, demonstrating my commitment to maintaining robust security protocols.
            Additionally, I directed the integration of cloud services into existing IT environments, cutting operational costs 
            by 30% and significantly improving disaster recovery capabilities. These achievements reflect my strategic thinking,
             technical proficiency, and ability to drive impactful changes within organizations.
